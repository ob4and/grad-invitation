# Grad Web — Web Invitation   🎉
**Digital Exhibition Entry Page (2024)**

## Overview
This project is a web-based invitation page designed to connect  
online discovery with offline exhibition attendance for the  
Kongju University Graduation Exhibition.

The page delivers essential exhibition information—date, location,  
and access—through a single, streamlined landing experience.

## Role
- Direction & Design Supervision  
- UX Structure Definition  
- Quality Control & Review  

> I supervised and managed the overall direction of the web invitation.  
> The main development and production were handled by team members.

## Key Design Focus
- **Entry-focused UX**  
  Designed as a single-page flow guiding users from information recognition to location access.
- **Online–Offline Connection**  
  Integrated map API to support seamless transition from web to physical space.
- **Minimal Navigation**  
  Reduced unnecessary exploration to prioritize exhibition entry clarity.

## Outcome
