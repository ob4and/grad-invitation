# Grad Web — Web Invitation  ✉️
**Digital Exhibition Entry Page (2024)**

## Overview
This project is a web-based invitation page designed to connect  
online discovery with offline exhibition attendance for the  
Kongju University Graduation Exhibition.

The page delivers essential exhibition information—date, location,  
and access—through a single, streamlined landing experience.
